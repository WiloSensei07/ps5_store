Mobile site for the sale of video game consoles. This project was realized by TCHAMENI ROSE and TCHATCHOU Wilfried. This application is a mobile e-commerce application on android. At the time of its launch, the user can see a catchword and the description of the application on several slides. He will then be connected to a page where he can select his items.

Tasks performed :

- Modification of the start page of the application
- Change of the application's logo in the phone
- Set up an Onboarding
- Login page and accessibility to Firebase
- Creation of a user catalogue page of the console and its accessories with the possibility to see each accessory separately

During this project we encountered the following difficulty :

- The pooling of our respective pages (catalogue page and the rest of the pages of the application).
